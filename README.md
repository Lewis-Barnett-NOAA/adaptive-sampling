# adaptive-sampling

Code and data for an idealized simulation study of adaptive sampling when the environment drives a poleward gradient in species' population densities that varies in strength among years. 

We explored whether a linear model of March sea ice extent in the Bering Sea could be used to predict summer cold pool extent. Then we tested whether predictions from this early indicator of summer thermal gradient could improve estimates of population abundance when sample allocations followed a control rule based on predicted cold pool extent.

Analyses were conducted by Lewis Barnett and Dylan Fournier.
